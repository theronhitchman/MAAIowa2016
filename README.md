##Title:
Butterfly representations for Knots and Links

## Speaker:
Theron J Hitchman

## Abstract:
A “butterfly representation” for a knot is a way to represent that knot with a
kind of graph on the sphere. This generalization of Thurston’s construction of
the Borromean rings was introduced by Hilden, Montesinos, Tejada, and Toro to
give a new approach to the study of the bridge index of knots.

We will introduce the ideas with lots of examples (pictures and physical models)
and discuss the connection with the classical bridge index invariant.
